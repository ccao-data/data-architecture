  dbt found two schema.yml entries for the same resource named proximity.vw_pin10_proximity_fill. Resources and their associated columns may only be described a single time. To fix this, remove one of the resource entries for proximity.vw_pin10_proximity_fill in this file:
   - models/proximity/schema.yml
