# vw_nonlivable_condos_with_chars

For example, if an appeal has a `change` value of "change" but the certified
assessed value of its PIN is the same as its mailed value, this view will
return the appeal. Likewise, if an appeal has a "no change" value for `change`
but the certified assessed value of its PIN is different from its mailed
value, this view will also return the appeal.

# vw_report_town_close_prior_year_card_code_5s

{% docs view_vw_report_town_close_prior_year_card_code_5s %}
Check for records that received a 1-year value reduction in the prior year
(card code 5s) but whose value is not back up to 100% when compared to the
prior year value and occupancy factor.

One year reductions are reduced by a percentage, which is recorded in the
occupancy field, even if it's not technically a reduction due to occupancy.
That way the system can just use the percentage to bring the value up to 100%
when rolling over to a new year of data. If the record was not brought back up
to 100%, the "2023 % of 2024" column will not match the 2023 occupancy and the
card will appear in this report.

Note that in some cases there are slight discrepancies due to rounding and
Board decisions, which are indicated by a card code 5B instead of 5.

This view is exported as part of the QC report to check values prior to town
closings.

# vw_report_town_close_res_parcels_not_set_to_cost_approach

{% docs view_vw_report_town_close_res_parcels_not_set_to_cost_approach %}
Check for residential class parcels that do not have "1: Cost Approach" set
for their Valuation Method.

This might seem counter-intuitive since residential parcels are not generally
valued using a cost approach, but it stems from the fact that "1: Cost Approach"
is actually used as a flag to indicate that we valued the parcel the normal way
using the data in the `LAND`/`DWELDAT`/`COMDAT`/`OBY` tables rather than using
overrides in the "Land/Building/Total Value Estimate" fields.
