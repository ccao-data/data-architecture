      Parcel sales for real property in Cook County, from 1999 to present.

Sales paired with characteristics can be used to find comparable properties or as an input to an automated modeling application. Sales paired with assessments can be used to calculate sales ratio statistics. Outliers can be easily removed using filters constructed from class, township, and year variables.
