# corner

{% docs table_corner %}
CCAO corner lot indicator. Determined algorithmically by unobstructed access to
perpendicular streets.

The algorithm is:

1. Find the minimum rectangle that bounds the parcel, then use that
   rectangle to determine the parcel's orientation and length. These values
   are used in the next step to draw a cross on the parcel.
2. Draw a cross that cuts the parcel in four and extends out slightly
   beyond the minimum rectangle of the parcel. We will look for parcels and
   streets that intersect this cross in order to determine neighbors. Use the
   bearing and length calculated in the previous step to draw the cross (i.e
   the long side of the cross is parallel to the minimum bounding rectangle).
3. Find the arms of each cross which intersect neighboring parcels, where those
   neighboring parcels _also_ touch the cross-originating PIN. The idea here is
   that cross arms that intersect neighboring (touching) parcels are likely to
   be pointed at a building, rather than a street. Delete these arms from the
   cross.
4. Find which remaining cross segments intersect streets, and keep only
   segments that _do_ intersect. This removes segments pointed at buildings,
   empty space, etc.
5. Calculate the angle of remaining cross segments in order to filter
   out segments that are not at right angles. If a parcel >= 3 cross segments
   remaining, it is a corner. If a parcel has 2 cross segments remaining and
   they form a 90 degree angle, it is a corner. All other cases are not
   corners.
