analysis. For example, land rates are usually delimited by neighborhood
{% enddocs %}

## pin

{% docs shared_column_pin %}
Full Property Index Number.

The index number is a brief legal description of a particular parcel by
numerical reference to parcels on assessment maps. It is also the primary unit

The county is divided into 38 geographic townships. These townships act as

can also be units of local government, with their own boards and taxing
authority. Townships in the City of Chicago are effectively vestigial
{% enddocs %}

## triad_code

Triads are the "unit of yearly work" for the Cook County property system:
one triad is reassessed every 3 years on a rotating cycle. Each triad is made

- `1` = City
- `2` = North
- `3` = South
{% enddocs %}

## triad_name

{% docs shared_column_triad_name %}
Cook County triad name.

Triads are the "unit of yearly work" for the Cook County property system:
one triad is reassessed every 3 years on a rotating cycle. Each triad is made

or `City` (Chicago)
{% enddocs %}

## year

{% docs shared_column_year %}

# Proration, Multi-cards, and Landlines

## card_proration_rate

are valued slightly differently than single-card ones.
{% enddocs %}

## pin_num_landlines

{% docs shared_column_pin_num_landlines %}
Number of landlines associated with a PIN.

Each landlines is typically associated with an individual land rate i.e.
rate varies within the PIN. The sum of all landline square footage _should_ be equal to the total square footage of the parcel. Each landline can correspond to a different land price/rate. NOTE: there are cases where land itself is prorated, in which case landline values may not sum to the parcel square footage.
{% enddocs %}

## pin_num_lline

{% docs shared_column_pin_num_lline %}
Number of `lline` values associated with a PIN
{% enddocs %}

## tieback_key_pin

{% docs shared_column_tieback_key_pin %}

See `tieback_proration_rate` for explanation of PIN-level proration.
{% enddocs %}

## tieback_proration_rate

{% docs shared_column_tieback_proration_rate %}
Proration rate applied to the PIN.

PINs are occasionally prorated when not all of their value is contained within
their boundaries. For example, a building that lies equally across two PINs
would be prorated to 50%. In this case, the _land_ value of the PIN is not
prorated, but the building value is.
