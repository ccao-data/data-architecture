Generally, the column name should describe the reason; for example,
`reason_over_valuation` means the applicant claims that the appeal is justified
by overvaluation. The one exception to this pattern is reason_other, which
relies on the reason_other_description column to provide a description of the
appeal reason.

Possible values for this variable are:

- TRUE: The applicant selected this reason
- FALSE: The applicant did not select this reason
- NULL: We are unsure, but we think this is equivalent to FALSE

it still counts as one appeal, though it results in multiple
value changes. To our knowledge, `subkey` is only relevant
when analyzing appeal actions, which are recorded in
`iasworld.htval`.

- `1` = 1 story (`1STRY`)
- `2` = 2 story (`2STRY`)
- `3` = 3 story or more (`3STRY+`)

Note that while `6`, `7`, `8`, and `9` indicate specific values between 1 and
2 stories, we currently collapse them to a single `1.5STRY` value since these
intermediate values are rare and currently do not have enough signal to be
useful for modeling.

algorithm has not evaluated this sale, and you should not rely
on those columns.

by our sales validation algorithm or our analyst review process.

Possible values for this variable are:

  a major characteristic problem
- `Review: Non-Arms-Length`: Outlier due to analyst reviewer finding the
  transaction was not arm's-length, and the algorithm finding the sale price to
  be unusual
- `Review: Flip`: Outlier due to analyst reviewer finding the sale to be a flip,
  and the algorithm finding the sale price to be unusual
- `Review: Valid Sale`: Non-outlier due to analyst reviewer finding the sale to
  be arm's-length and open market with correct characteristics
- `Algorithm: Outlier Sale`: Outlier due to our sales validation algorithm
  finding one or more issues with the sale. The exact reasons for the
  algorithm's decision will be appended to the end of this value as a
  comma-separated string, like
  `Algorithm: Outlier Sale, High Price, Statistical Anomaly`

## sv_is_outlier

{% docs shared_column_sv_is_outlier %}
Indicates an outlier sale not used in modeling or reporting.

A null value represents an observation that, due to
filters on type of sale or time frame of sale, is
excluded completely from the sales-val model pipeline

to determine which parameters were used to create specific sales flags
