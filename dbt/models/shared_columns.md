be equal to the total square footage of the parcel. Each landline can
correspond to a different land price/rate. NOTE: there are cases where land
itself is prorated, in which case landline values may not sum to the parcel
square footage
{% enddocs %}

prorated, but the building value is.

## sv_is_heuristic_outlier

{% docs shared_column_sv_is_heuristic_outlier %}
Heuristic outlier flagged by [model-sales-val](https://github.com/ccao-data/model-sales-val).

A null value represents an observation that, due to
filters on type of sale or time frame of sale, is
excluded completely from the sales-val model pipeline
and therefore does receive a boolean value.

NOTE: Outlier flags only exist for sales _after_ 2013.
Sales before 2014 will have a null value for this column.

to determine which parameters were used to create specific sales flags
{% enddocs %}
