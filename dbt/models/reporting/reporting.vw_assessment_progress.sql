-- Gathers AVs by year, major class, assessment stage, and municipality for

/* Ensure every municipality/class/year has a row for every stage through
cross-joining. This is to make sure that combinations that do not yet
exist in iasworld.asmt_all for the current year will exist in the view, but have
largely empty columns. For example: even if no class 4s in the City of Chicago
have been mailed yet for the current assessment year, we would still like an
empty City of Chicago/class 4 row to exist for the mailed stage. */

/* This CTE removes historical PINs in default.vw_pin_universe that are
not in reporting.vw_pin_value_long. We do this to make sure the samples we
derive the numerator and denominator from for pct_pin_w_value_in_group are the
same. These differences are inherent in the tables that feed these views
(iasworld.pardat and iasworld.asmt_all, respectively) and are data errors - not
emblematic of what portion of a municipality has actually progressed through an
assessment stage.

It does NOT remove PINs from the most recent year of
default.vw_pin_universe since we expect differences based on how
iasworld.asmt_all is populated through the year as the assessment cycle
progresses. This means data errors caused by differences between iasworld.pardat
and iasworld.asmt_all won't be addressed in the most recent year. Unfortunately,
we can't know what those errors are (or if they even exist) until asmt_all has
at least one fully complete stage for a given year.

Starting in 2020 a small number of PINs are present in iasworld.asmt_all for
one or two but not all three stages of assessment when we would expect all three
stages to be present for said PINs. This is also a data error, but is NOT
addressed in this view and leads to a few instances where
pct_pin_w_value_in_group ends up being less than 1 when it should equal 1.
16-07-219-029-1032 missing a mailed value but having CCAO and BOR certified
values in 2021 is an example. */
