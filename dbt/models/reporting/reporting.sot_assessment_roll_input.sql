cross-joining. This is to make sure that combinations that do not yet
exist in iasworld.asmt_all for the current year will exist in the view, but have
largely empty columns. For example: even if no class 4s in the City of Chicago
have been mailed yet for the current assessment year, we would still like an
empty City of Chicago/class 4 row to exist for the mailed stage. */
