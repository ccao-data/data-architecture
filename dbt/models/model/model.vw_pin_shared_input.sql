/*
View containing cleaned, filled data for residential and condo modeling. This
view functions as a pre-cursor to the separate residential and condo modeling
input views with the goal of sharing as much code as possible for the sake of
consistency. Missing data is filled with the following steps:

1. All historical data is filled FORWARD in time, i.e. data from 2020 fills
   2021 as long as the data isn't something which frequently changes
2. Current data is filled BACKWARD to account for missing historical data.
   Again, this is only for things unlikely to change

WARNING: This is a very heavy view. Don't use it for anything other than making
extracts for modeling
