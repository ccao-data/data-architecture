[sqlfluff:indentation]
# Ideally we would like to lint template block indentation, but in practice
# it doesn't work with dbt macros -- specifically, it doesn't know how to
# properly nest blocks like `for` and `if` inside a macro tag like `test` or
# `macro`. The dbt plugin is also slow, experimental, and requires access to
# the data warehouse we use for dbt, which defeats the purpose of a pre-commit
# hook. If we were to use dbt, we also wouldn't be able to set a different
# templater for our non-dbt directories in this repo.
# See: https://docs.sqlfluff.com/en/2.1.4/configuration.html#dbt-templater
# for a good breakdown of the pros/cons of using the dbt plugin. Hopefully
# future development will make it a more appealing choice.
