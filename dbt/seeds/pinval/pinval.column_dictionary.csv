Statistical model,model,The Assessor�s statistical model is a computer program that uses vast amounts of data about past home sales to estimate current values.
PIN,pin,"A PIN, or property index number (also called a permanent real estate index number), is a unique 14-digit number that represents a parcel of land for taxation purposes. PINs can be vacant land, have one card (building) on them, or multiple cards (buildings)."
