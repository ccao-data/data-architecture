# Run tests on our open data assets to confirm that their row counts match
# the row counts of the underlying Athena tables when grouped by year.
#
# Requires one positional argument, the path to a dbt manifest that can be
# used to parse exposure data representing open data assets and their
# dependency graph.
#
# Exposures that should be tested are required to have a `meta.test_row_count`
# attribute set to `true`. Exposures that do not have this attribute set to
# `true` will not be tested.
#
# Example usage:
#
#   cd dbt
#   python3 ../.github/scripts/test_open_data_assets.py target/manifest.json
