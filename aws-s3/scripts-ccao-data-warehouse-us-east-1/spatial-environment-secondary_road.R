# This script is designed to ingest spatial data on secondary roads for each
# year from 2014 to the present, simplify it for efficiency, and store a
# deduplicated, aggregated version of this data in a warehouse bucket.
#
# We take an additive approach here to ensure distance to these roads is
# consistent from earlier pin-level data. If there are new secondary roads in
# 2015 data, they will be added to existing 2014 secondary roads data, and that
# addition will become our 2015 secondary roads data. If there are identical
# osm_id observations between 2014 and 2015, we preserve the data from 2014.
#
# We only add new secondary roads if they were not previously major roads, are
# not in the corresponding year data in our additive major roads, and if they
# don't become major roads in the future. This is accomplished by filtering on
# osm_id and name, along with some spatial network cleaning to clean up what was
# missed. This is to prevent classifying a road as both major and secondary.
